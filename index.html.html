			<h2>Subtheme: Zoning and Housing Supply</h2>

			<h3>Overall Analysis Questions</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Are there significantly more single family homes being zoned than other housing types?</li>
				<li>Have the rates of zoning changed much over the recorded timespan?</li>
				<li>What kind of housing besides single family is in highest demand?</li>
			</ol>

				I wanted to start by getting a better idea of what information exists in the dataset. To do so, I started with a deep-dive of the metadata, and noticed that two major components were munincipality info and demographic-related data. Wanting to take a closer look at the former, I was curious if there was any correlation between where single-family homes were and where MBTA stops were (since I assume those locations would generally be well-suited for more population-dense housing types). I was surprised to see that some single-family majority areas were MBTA community marked, but the majority were not. Interestingly, there were a number of munincipalities with 0% single family zoning area. For clarity, those are removed from this visualization, but are futher explored in the next.

				Next I was curious about the municipalities that had a low single-family zoning percentage. Thus I looked only at municipalities where that figure was 5% or lower, and checked to see whether there were more MBTA community marked areas than the single-family dominant municipalities had. Interestingly, there were still not many marked as an MBTA community. This was curious to me, especially since Braintree was marked as a non-MBTA...
